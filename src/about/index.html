  <h1>What is this?</h1>
  <p>This experiment is part of a project done by us (Benedikt Klinglmayr,
    Samo Kolter, Mario Stoff, and Tobias Ungerb√∂ck), four Master's students in Informatics at <a
      href="https://www.tuwien.at/">TU Wien</a>, as
    part of the
    <a
      href="https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?dswid=1070&dsrid=267&courseNr=193056&semester=2022W&locale=en">User
      Research Methods course</a>. In this project, we explore how and when people listen to music and other forms of
    auditory media (e.g. Podcasts, audio books) and how it influences them, both on an
    emotional level and in terms of performance, using a mixed-methods approach.
  </p>
  <p>Our goal with this experiment is to find out whether background music influences participant performance in
    a selection of cognitive tests. Due to lack of time and financial resources, it was impossible for us to do this
    experiment on-site
    proved difficult. So, we instead built this web app that allows anyone to participate in our experiment from
    anywhere they want. We hope to collect as many responses as possible. <b>If you haven't participated yet, we would
      be
      very grateful if you take the time for it as well!</b></p>
  </p>
  <h2>Experiment Setup</h2>
  <p>Every website visitor is assigned to one of two test groups that both complete the same set of tasks. The
    only difference is that one group is asked to complete the tasks in complete silence, while the other should listen
    to instrumental music from <a href="https://youtu.be/CLeZyIID9Bo?t=1" target="_blank">this</a> YouTube video in the
    background.</p>
  </p>
  <p>The task performance data is stored in the cloud automatically and will be collected and analyzed
    by us at the end of the experiment trial period (some time in January 2023). <b>No personal data is stored in the
      process.</b></p>
  <h2>Related Resources</h2>
  <p>We hope to get some interesting insights from this experiment. If we find anything worth sharing, we will link our
    project report here. If you are interested in the implementation details, check out the code repository for this
    website on <a href="https://github.com/Sejmou/urm-pr-experiment">GitHub</a>.</p>
